# goprotowrap

⚠️ **The Go plugin for `protoc` got smarter: you should no longer need this**

A package-at-a-time wrapper for protoc, for generating Go protobuf
code.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/square/goprotowrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/square/goprotowrap)

`protowrap` is a small tool we found helpful when working with
[protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) in
Go at Square. We're publishing it in the hope that others find it
useful too. Contributions are welcome.

## Install

```shell
go get -u github.com/threadshare/goprotowrap/cmd/protowrap
```

## Philosophy

Unlike other language plugins, the Go
[protobuf plugin](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) expects to be
called separately for each package, ~and given all files in that
package~ (fixed).

`protowrap` is called instead of `protoc`, and ensures that `.proto`
files are processed one Go package at a time.

It parses out the flags it understands, passing the rest through to
`protoc` unchanged.

## Operation

- search for all `.proto` files under the same import paths as the
  `.proto` file arguments
- call `protoc` to generate FileDescriptorProtos
- inspect the FileDescriptorProtos to deduce package information
- group `.proto` files into packages
- call `protoc` once for each package

## TODOs

- [x] Replace square-specific handling of `go_package` with
      recently updated upstream logic.
- [ ] In the initial call to `protoc` for generating
      FileDescriptorProtos, pass `.proto` files to `protoc` in batches
      instead of all at once.
- [ ] Better tests, especially of the code paths not exercised by our
      build process.
